            <h1>Facts about New York City</h1>
            <p id="top">
                New York City. The Big Apple. The Concrete Jungle.
                Its well known that it's America's biggest city and
                it's financial center but there's plenty more to this city
                than yellow taxis and the visuals shown in blockbuster movies.

                <h2>The Abandoned Island</h2>
                <p class="brotherIsland">North Brother Island is an abandoned island that sits 
                    in the East River, situated between The Bronx and 
                    Rikers Island. The island was previously used to 
                    quarantine people who had diseases such as small pox 
                    and tuberculosis. The island was used for this prupose from 1885 to 
                    about 1940.
                </p>
                <p class="brotherIsland">After World War II, due to a housing shortage, the island was used to 
                    house veterans of the war. This remained until the 1950s when the island 
                    was used to treat adolescent drug addicts. Since the 1960s the island has 
                    been uninhabited and has become somewhat of a bird sanctuary and is off limits 
                    to the public.
